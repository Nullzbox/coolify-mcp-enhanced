# Known Issues

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Coolify Beta Versions (v4.0.0-beta.434 and earlier)

### Issue: `/applications/private-github-app` endpoint returns 404

**Affected Versions:**
- Coolify v4.0.0-beta.434
- Likely affects other beta versions around beta.380 - beta.434

**Symptoms:**
- API call to `POST /api/v1/applications/private-github-app` returns:
  ```json
  {"message": "Github App not found."}
  ```
- HTTP Status: 404
- Occurs even with valid `github_app_uuid` that exists in `/api/v1/security/keys`

**Root Cause:**
- The endpoint exists in the codebase but has validation issues in beta versions
- Related GitHub Issues:
  - [#4864](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/issues/4864) - github_app_uuid & SecurityKey.uuid mismatch
  - [#5467](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/issues/5467) - Private GitHub apps API timeouts
  - [#5540](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/issues/5540) - validateDataApplications method missing

**Workaround:**
1. **Use `/applications/public` endpoint** (creates app but with `source_id: 0`)
   - Works but app cannot access private repositories
   - Cannot modify `source_id` via PATCH (field rejected)

2. **Create applications manually via Coolify UI** ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED
   - Fastest and most reliable method
   - UI properly links GitHub App to application

3. **Update Coolify to stable version**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
   ```

**MCP Tool Status:**
- ‚úÖ `create_application` (public repos) - WORKS
- ‚ùå `create_application_private_github_app` - BROKEN in beta versions
- ‚úÖ All other tools (list, get, update, delete, deploy) - WORK

**Verified Working:**
- Validation error reporting (v1.4.6) ‚úÖ
- Error details with `VALIDATION_ERRORS` field ‚úÖ
- GitHub App listing via `/security/keys` ‚úÖ
- Application CRUD operations ‚úÖ

**Testing Results:**
```bash
# Version check
curl http://nullbase.xyz:8000/api/v1/version
# Returns: 4.0.0-beta.434

# Working endpoint
POST /api/v1/applications/public
# Result: Creates app with source_id: 0

# Broken endpoint
POST /api/v1/applications/private-github-app
# Result: {"message": "Github App not found."}
```

**Resolution:**
Wait for Coolify stable release or update to latest version where this endpoint is confirmed working.

## üìã Testing Checklist for Future Versions

When testing a new Coolify version:

1. Check version:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" http://your-coolify.com/api/v1/version
   ```

2. List GitHub Apps:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" http://your-coolify.com/api/v1/security/keys
   ```

3. Test private GitHub app creation:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://your-coolify.com/api/v1/applications/private-github-app \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "test-app",
       "project_uuid": "...",
       "server_uuid": "...",
       "environment_name": "production",
       "github_app_uuid": "...",
       "git_repository": "owner/repo",
       "git_branch": "main",
       "build_pack": "dockerfile",
       "ports_exposes": "3000",
       "destination_uuid": "..."
     }'
   ```

4. Expected success response:
   ```json
   {
     "uuid": "app-uuid-here",
     "domains": null
   }
   ```

## üîß Workaround Implementation

If you need to use the MCP with beta versions, temporarily use `create_application` (public) and note that private repos won't work until manual configuration.
