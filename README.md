# üöÄ Enhanced Coolify MCP Server

An enhanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) with **MCPaaS deployment capabilities**. This server enables AI assistants to deploy and manage complete **Model Context Protocol Platform as a Service** infrastructure through natural language.

## ‚ú® What's New in This Enhanced Version

This is a significantly enhanced version of the [original Coolify MCP Server](https://github.com/StuMason/coolify-mcp) with powerful new features for **automated MCPaaS deployment**:

### üéØ **MCPaaS-Specific Features**
- **One-click MCPaaS project creation** with `create_mcpaas_project`
- **Automated infrastructure deployment** with `deploy_mcpaas_stack`
- **Complete application lifecycle management**
- **Automated deployment scripts** for zero-configuration setup

### üõ†Ô∏è **Enhanced Application Management**
- Create, list, get, delete applications with full configuration
- Monitor application resource usage and performance
- Real-time log streaming and analysis
- Environment variable bulk management
- Docker Compose service deployment

### üìä **Advanced Deployment Management**
- List, monitor, and cancel deployments in real-time
- Deployment status tracking and notifications
- Automated rollback and recovery capabilities

## üé¨ Quick Start - Deploy MCPaaS in Minutes

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/dazeb/coolify-mcp-enhanced.git
cd coolify-mcp-enhanced
npm install && npm run build

# 2. Configure your environment
export COOLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-coolify-api-token"
export COOLIFY_BASE_URL="https://your-coolify-instance.com"
export MCPAAS_DOMAIN="mcpaas.yourdomain.com"

# 3. Deploy MCPaaS automatically
node deploy-mcpaas.js
```

**That's it!** Your complete MCPaaS platform will be deployed with:
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database
- ‚úÖ Redis cache  
- ‚úÖ MinIO object storage
- ‚úÖ MCPaaS frontend application
- ‚úÖ All networking and SSL configured
