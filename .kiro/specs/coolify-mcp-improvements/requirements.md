# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the Coolify MCP server based on the comprehensive testing results. The improvements focus on enhancing service creation workflows, error handling, and user experience while maintaining the excellent existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Service Creation Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer using the MCP server, I want to create services without manually specifying environment details, so that I can quickly deploy infrastructure components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a service without environment_name or environment_uuid THEN the system SHALL automatically detect or create a default environment
2. WHEN service creation fails due to missing parameters THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested fixes
3. WHEN listing available service types THEN the system SHALL include parameter requirements for each service type
4. WHEN creating a service THEN the system SHALL validate all required parameters before making API calls

### Requirement 2: Improved Application Creation Process

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create applications through the MCP server reliably, so that I can deploy applications programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an application THEN the system SHALL validate destination and environment requirements
2. WHEN application creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information including missing parameters
3. WHEN creating an application THEN the system SHALL support automatic environment and destination selection
4. WHEN application creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL return complete application details including deployment status

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear and actionable error messages when operations fail, so that I can quickly resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API call fails THEN the system SHALL parse and format error responses appropriately
2. WHEN receiving "Not found" errors THEN the system SHALL provide context about what resource was not found
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL list all missing or invalid parameters
4. WHEN operations succeed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive success feedback

### Requirement 4: Infrastructure Stack Deployment Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy complete infrastructure stacks easily, so that I can set up full application environments quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying infrastructure stack THEN the system SHALL automatically handle environment creation if needed
2. WHEN stack deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities
3. WHEN deploying services THEN the system SHALL support dependency ordering
4. WHEN infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide connection details and credentials

### Requirement 5: Parameter Validation and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand what parameters are required for each operation, so that I can use the MCP server effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling any tool THEN the system SHALL validate parameters before API calls
2. WHEN parameters are missing THEN the system SHALL suggest default values where applicable
3. WHEN using create operations THEN the system SHALL provide parameter examples
4. WHEN operations require complex configuration THEN the system SHALL offer simplified presets

### Requirement 6: Deployment Management Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable access to deployment information and logs, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing deployment history THEN the system SHALL handle missing deployments gracefully
2. WHEN deployment information is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide alternative status information
3. WHEN retrieving logs THEN the system SHALL support filtering and pagination
4. WHEN deployments fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure reasons

### Requirement 7: Service Type Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily discover and use available service types, so that I can deploy the right services for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN listing service types THEN the system SHALL include descriptions and requirements
2. WHEN creating services THEN the system SHALL support service type validation
3. WHEN service types have dependencies THEN the system SHALL handle them automatically
4. WHEN custom configurations are needed THEN the system SHALL provide templates

### Requirement 8: Retry Logic and Resilience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to handle transient failures gracefully, so that temporary issues don't break my workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail with transient errors THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic
2. WHEN retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL provide clear failure information
3. WHEN operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL support status polling
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully
